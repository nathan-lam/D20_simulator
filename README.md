# D20_simulator

A (work in progress) analysis of the D&D 5e battle system, inspired by [a similar analysis](https://github.com/cyberscribe/d20datascience)


I have 2 goals for this project
* To give my own take on this analysis
* Make a D&D simulator, adding any implementable features to best represent a fight.
